# Cafe Management System in python
 The Cafe Management System is a Python-based project that simulates a simple restaurant ordering process. It allows users to view a menu, place orders, specify quantities, and calculate the total bill, including automatic discounts for large orders. Key features include menu display, order handling, item removal, and payment method selection. Additionally, it generates a detailed bill that is saved as a text file. This project demonstrates core Python skills like input handling, loops, conditionals, and file management, making it a perfect beginner-friendly project. Future enhancements could include a graphical user interface (GUI) and integration with a database for tracking orders.
